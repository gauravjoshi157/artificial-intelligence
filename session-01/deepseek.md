# `Deepseek` 

- `Deepseek` is a Artificial Intelligence Company which recently released its one of the top leading LLMs in the market. 
- `Deepseek`  models (R1 and V3) are optimized for enhance reasoning capabilities, long context, better logic and less computetional cost and better adaptability.
- `Deepseek` R1 model uses advanced `attention mechanism`. 
    - `Attention Mechanism:` This is the mechanism which is used for focusing different part of the input for better understanding.
    - `Longer Context Retention:` `Deepseek` models has better in remembering the long context.
- `Deepseek` R1 model has faster inference and low latency.
    - `Inference`: It is the process of using a trained model for making predictions on a new data. `Deepseek` R1 has optimized inference while maintaining the quality of the content.
    - `Latency`: `Latency` is the time taken from taking a request and giving the response. `Deepseek` has low latency but it not compromise in the quality of the content for faster response.
- `Deepseek` models are optimized for reducing `bias` and `hallucination`.
    - `Bias`: `Bias` is the tendency of the output which is occur due to the data on which the model is trained on.  
    - `Hallucination`: When the model produce the incorrect answers which does not in the sense of the context of the input.
